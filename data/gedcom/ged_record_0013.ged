**Explanation of Changes and Assumptions:**

* **Individuals (INDI) and Families (FAM):** Each person and marriage gets its own record, linked by pointers (@I13@, @F1@, etc.).
* **Names:** Surnames are enclosed in slashes (e.g., /AMAN/).
* **Marriage (MARR):** The marriage date and place are under the FAM record.
* **Birth (BIRT):**  Elisabetha Aman's birth information is included.
* **Linking to @1667@:** This is kept as a NOTE.  GEDCOM doesn't have a standardized way to represent a link to an external database entry, so a note is the most common practice.  You might also use a custom tag like _LINK if your genealogy software supports it.
* **ANSCHÜTZ:**  This is also treated as a NOTE, as its relationship to Johann Georg Häuser isn't clear.  It could be a title, a second surname, an occupation, or something else.  Further research would be needed to determine the correct tag.  If it were a confirmed second surname, you might use 1 NAME Johann Georg /Häuser/ /ANSCHÜTZ/.
* **Missing Information:** The GEDCOM format requires a husband and wife for a family record. Since Elisabetha Ott's birth and death dates are unknown, placeholders are used.  Similarly,  the marriage date for Elisabetha Aman and Johann Georg Häuser is unknown.


This conversion makes several assumptions due to the ambiguity of the original text.  If you have more context, the GEDCOM can be refined further.  For example, if ANSCHÜTZ is a place name related to Johann Georg Häuser, it could be added as a residence (RESI) event.
