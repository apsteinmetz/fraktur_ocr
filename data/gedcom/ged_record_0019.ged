**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Unique Identifiers:**  Each individual and family needs a unique identifier.  I've added `@I20@`, `@I21@`, `@I22@`, `@F1@`, and `@F2@`. You should replace these with your own numbering scheme.  Critically, the provided `@1664@` is assumed to already exist in your file.
* **Family Records:** Marriage information requires creating `FAM` records to link the spouses and children.
* **Surnames:**  Surnames are enclosed in `/` for better GEDCOM compatibility.
* **Standard Date Format:** Dates are formatted as DAY MONTH YEAR.
* **Linking to @1664@:**  The `ALIA` tag is used to link the Christian H채user record to the pre-existing `@1664@` record. This indicates they are the same person.  Using `ALIA` allows software to recognize the connection.


This revised GEDCOM is more complete and structured, facilitating better import and interpretation by genealogy software.  Remember to replace the placeholder IDs with your own unique identifiers and integrate this into your larger GEDCOM file.
