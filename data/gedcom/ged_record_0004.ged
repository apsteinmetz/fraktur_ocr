**Explanation of Changes and Assumptions:**

* **Unique Identifiers:** Each individual and family needs a unique identifier (e.g., @I4@, @F1@, @H1@, @W1@). Make sure these are consistent throughout your GEDCOM file.
* **Family Relationships:** The `FAMS` and `CHIL` tags link Adolf Michael to his parents' family.  `HUSB` and `WIFE` tags identify the parents within the family record. You will need to create the parent records (@H1@ and @W1@) separately, and replace the placeholders with their actual IDs if they exist already.
* **Standard Tags:** `BIRT`, `DEAT`, `BURI`, and `BAPM` (baptism) are standard GEDCOM tags.
* **Place Information:** `PLAC` is used for locations.
* **Godparents:** `GODP` is used for godparents, and `ROLE` clarifies their relationship (ref = godfather, ev = godmother â€“ these are not standardized but help interpretation).  Consider using `NOTE`s for non-standard roles.
* **Names:** Surnames are enclosed in slashes `/ /` in the parents' records to distinguish them.
* **Missing Information:**  The provided text only includes basic information.  As you find more information (birth place, etc.), add it to the appropriate records using the correct GEDCOM tags.
* **(aged 2 months 6 days):** This age information is helpful but redundant. GEDCOM software can calculate this from the birth and death dates.  You can include this information in a `NOTE` if you wish to preserve it.

**Important:** This conversion assumes you will create separate individual records for the parents (Adolf Marr and Julianna Welker).  The placeholder IDs (@H1@ and @W1@) *must* be replaced with the actual IDs of their records if they already exist in your GEDCOM file, or you must create these records with the given IDs.  Failing to do so will lead to inconsistencies and errors in your genealogical data.
