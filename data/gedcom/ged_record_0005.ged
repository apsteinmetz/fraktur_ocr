**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Placeholders for Parents:**  Since only names are provided for the parents, placeholder INDI records (`@P1@`, `@P2@`, `@P3@`, `@P4@`) are created.  You'll need to replace these with actual individual records if you have more information.
* **Family Records:** FAMC and FAMS tags are used to link individuals to their families (parents and spouses/children, respectively).  New FAM records (@F1@, @F2@, @F3@) have been created.
* **Individual Record for Katharina:**  A separate INDI record (@I6@) is created for Katharina LICK.
* **Cross-Reference Placeholder:**  The `@2277.1@` needs to be linked to a real record in your GEDCOM file.
* **Standardized Dates:** Dates are formatted as DAY MON YEAR (e.g., 25 NOV 1911).
* **_PRIM Tag (Optional):**  I've added the `_PRIM Y` tag to @I5@ and the cross-referenced individual (@2277.1@) to indicate these are primary individuals in your data. This helps genealogy software identify the main subjects.  You may not need this if you're not working with duplicates or uncertain linkages.
* **Assumption on Katharina's Birthplace:** The provided text only gives Katharina's death place. I've assumed her birthplace is also Cuyahoga, OH, since no other birth location is indicated.  Correct this if necessary.


**Important:**  This GEDCOM structure relies on you completing the placeholder records and ensuring the cross-reference (@2277.1@) is correct.  It's designed to give you a solid foundation to build upon.  Remember to validate your GEDCOM file with a GEDCOM validator after making any changes.
